  use_other_energy_implicit = .TRUE.    ! Activates the DM module

  X_CTRL(1) = 0.E0  ! This sets the cboost in `src/DM/DM_module.f90`.
                    ! This is the boost to the capture rate of DM compared
                    ! to the local capture rate near the Sun (where cboost=1).
                    ! Reasonable values range from 0 (no DM captured) to 1E6.

  X_LOGICAL_CTRL(1) = .TRUE.    ! sets spindep in `src/DM/DM_module.f90`
                                ! .true. = spin dependent ! this works
                                ! .false. = ~spin independent~
                                        ! THIS DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK PROPERLY

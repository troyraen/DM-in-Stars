results intro:
%   \arz{For this first paragraph, I might attempt to do something like the following. I think this
%   gives a nice introduction to the basic result, incorporates what the reader needs to know about
%   low-and high-mass stars (so we can remove that part from the introduction), and segues into
%   the separate subsections about low- and high-mass stars. This may need some editing, but I hope
%   you get the idea.}

low mass stars: As stars with $\gb$ as low as $10^2$ (check this number) enter the MS, ADM is already transporting a significant amount of energy away from the center ($\epsx \approx \epspp$ near $r=0$) and depositing it in a shell at $m(<r) \approx 0.1 \Msun$. This causes the temperature, and therefore the burning rate, to be lower at the center and higher in a shell relative to standard models.

  \caption{$\Teff$ as a function of age for select $\gb$, with \nodm models overplotted as thin lines. Stars undergo a sharp decrease in $\Teff$ as they leave the MS. The change in MS lifetimes due to ADM can be seen in the time difference between these features. The surface effects of core oscillations discussed in \S~\ref{sub:lowmass} can be seen here in $\Teff$.

Notes:
hydrogen depletes in shell first. (low mass stars)

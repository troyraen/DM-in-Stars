abstract = {We study energy transport by asymmetric dark matter in the interiors of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. Our motivation is to explore astrophysical signatures of asymmetric dark matter, which otherwise may not be amenable to conventional indirect dark matter searches. In viable models, the additional cooling of very-low mass stellar cores can alter stellar properties. Asymmetric dark matter with mass 4 {\textless} Mx/GeV {\textless} 10 and a spin-dependent (spin-independent) cross sections of sigma $\backslash$sim 10{\^{}}{\{}-37{\}} cm{\^{}}2 (sigma $\backslash$sim 10{\^{}}{\{}-40{\}} cm{\^{}}2) can increase the minimum mass of main sequence hydrogen burning, partly determining whether or not the object is a star at all. Similar dark matter candidates reduce the luminosities of low-mass stars and accelerate the cooling of brown dwarfs. Such light dark matter is of particular interest given results from the DAMA, CoGeNT, and CRESST dark matter searches. We discuss possibilities for observing dark matter effects in stars in the solar neighborhood, globular clusters, and, of particular promise, local dwarf galaxies, among other environments, as well as exploiting these effects to constrain dark matter properties.},

The number of particles which would be captured by the sun up to its present age by the capture mechanism of scattering off individual nucleons in the sun and into bound orbits is computed. For scattering cross sections not too far from the value of 4 x 10 to the -36th sq cm, which is optimal for suppressing solar neutrinos, it is found that just the right number can be captured. The solutions to the neutrino problem in the sun and the missing mass problem in the Galaxy may thus be one and the same.},

This is because the structure equations have to be solved in parallel with the energy transport equations. If timesteps are chosen to be small enough, convergence is very rapid. It is convenient to reformulate the original structure equations as d ln r dm = 1 4$\pi$$\rho$r 3 ; d ln P dm = − Gm 4$\pi$P r 4 . In order to reduce the dynamic range of the variables, we definee x = ln r, y = ln P and q = ln $\rho$ and input an equation of state $\rho$(P) or equivalently q(y).

abstract = {We substantially update the capabilities of the open source software package Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), and its one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESA Star. Improvements in MESA Star's ability to model the evolution of giant planets now extends its applicability down to masses as low as one-tenth that of Jupiter. The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology enabled by the space-based Kepler and CoRoT missions motivates our full coupling of the ADIPLS adiabatic pulsation code with MESA Star. This also motivates a numerical recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more easily implemented when many nuclei are present at non-negligible abundances. This impacts the way in which MESA Star calculates semi-convective and thermohaline mixing. We exhibit the evolution of 3-8 Msun stars through the end of core He burning, the onset of He thermal pulses, and arrival on the white dwarf cooling sequence. We implement diffusion of angular momentum and chemical abundances that enable calculations of rotating-star models, which we compare thoroughly with earlier work. We introduce a new treatment of radiation-dominated envelopes that allows the uninterrupted evolution of massive stars to core collapse. This enables the generation of new sets of supernovae, long gamma-ray burst, and pair-instability progenitor models. We substantially modify the way in which MESA Star solves the fully coupled stellar structure and composition equations, and we show how this has improved MESA's performance scaling on multi-core processors. Updates to the modules for equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, and atmospheric boundary conditions are also provided. We describe the MESA Software Development Kit (SDK) that packages all the required components needed to form a unified and maintained build environment for MESA. [Abridged]},

Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is a suite of open source libraries for a wide range of applications in computational stellar astrophysics. A newly designed 1-D stellar evolution module, MESA star, combines many of the numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very-low mass to massive stars, including advanced evolutionary phases. MESA star solves the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP. Independently usable modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is constructed as a separate Fortran 95 library with its own public interface. Examples include comparisons to other codes and show evolutionary tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets; the complete evolution of a 1 Msun star from the pre-main sequence to a cooling white dwarf; the Solar sound speed profile; the evolution of intermediate mass stars through the thermal pulses on the He-shell burning AGB phase; the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the pre-main sequence to the onset of core collapse; stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and accretion onto a neutron star.

This would provide a measure of, or a limit on, the WIMP annihilation cross section. The annihilation cross section is, in turn, inversely related by a standard Lee-Weinberg calculation to the cosmological density of WIMPs, Omegax. If the next generation of detectors finds a signal from the sun, an upper bound, lower bound, or measurement of Omegax of O(0.1), depending on whether there is a comparable signal, no signal, or a small signal from the earth. The chain of reasoning which leads to this conclusion is broken if the WIMPs have primarily spin-dependent interaction cross sections, but this possibility may be checked using direct-detection experiments.

@article{Zentner2009High-energySun,
abstract = {A potential flux of high-energy neutrinos from the annihilation of dark matter particles trapped within the Sun has been exploited to place indirect limits on particle dark matter. In most models, the dark matter interacts weakly, but the possibility of a dark matter particle with a large cross section for elastic scattering with itself has been proposed in several contexts. I study the consequences of such dark matter self-interactions for the high-energy neutrino flux from annihilation within the Sun. The self-interaction may allow dark matter in the halo to be captured within the Sun by scattering off of previously-captured dark matter within the Sun. This effect is not negligible in acceptable and accessible regions of parameter space. Enhancements in the predicted high-energy neutrino flux from the Sun of tens to hundreds of percent can be realized in broad regions of parameter space. Enhancements as large as factors of several hundred may be realized in extreme regions of the viable parameter space. Large enhancements require the dark matter annihilation cross section to be relatively small, sigma*v {\textless}{\~{}} 10{\^{}}-27 cm{\^{}}3/s. This phenomenology is interesting. First, self-capture is negligible for the Earth, so dark matter self-interactions break the correspondence between the solar and terrestrial neutrino signals. Likewise, the correspondence between indirect and direct detection limits on scattering cross sections on nuclei is broken by the self-interaction. These broken correspondences may evince strong dark matter self-interactions. In some cases, self-capture can lead to observable indirect signals in regions of parameter space where limits on dark matter-nucleon cross sections from direct detection would indicate that no such signal should be observable.},

These captured particles may subsequently annihilate, heating the stellar core and preventing the WD from cooling.

We consider WDs in globular clusters (GCs) and dwarf galaxies. If the parameters of the DM particle are known, then the temperature of the coolest WD in a GC can be used to constrain the DM density of the cluster's halo (potentially even ruling out the presence of a halo if the inferred density is of order the ambient Galactic density). Recently several direct detection experiments have seen signals whose origins might be due to low mass DM. In this paper, we show that if these claims from CRESST, DAMA, CDMS-Si, and CoGeNT could be interpreted as DM, then observations of NGC 6397 limit the fraction of DM in that cluster to be {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}DM{\}}{\}} \backslashlesssim 10{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$}.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

  A preponderance of the evidence suggests that approximately $84\%$ of the matter budget of the 
  universe consists of a form of non-baryonic dark matter that has yet to be identified 
  \citep[e.g.,][]{jungman_etal96,Bertone+05,CosmicVisions17,Profumo+19}. 
  In the standard picture of cosmological structure formation, 
  galaxies form within the potential wells of large, 
  nearly virialized halos of dark matter \citep{white_rees78,blumenthal_etal84}. 
  If the dark matter interacts with standard model particles, 
  it can be captured by stars moving through dark matter halos 
  \citep{press_spergel85,krauss_etal85,gaisser_etal86,griest_seckel87}. 
  Once captured, continued scattering within the stellar interior contributes 
  to energy transport within the star, potentially altering its evolution \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Spergel1985EffectInterior,Taoso+10,Zentner2011AsymmetricDwarfs,Iocco+12,Lopes_Silk12,Casanellas_Lopes13,Casanellas+15,vincent_etal15,Murase_Shoemaker16,Lopes_silk19}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD

}\DIFaddend . 
  The significance of this energy transport depends on the following 
  properties (in addition to the properties of the star): 
  (1) the DM mass, $\mx$; 
  (2) the DM-nucleon scattering cross section, $\sigxn$; 
  and (3) the total number of DM particles captured by a star, $\Nx$, 
  which itself depends on $\mx$ and $\sigxn$ as well as the local DM environment from 
which the particles are captured (see \S~\ref{sec:props}). 
We study the effects of energy transport by asymmetric dark matter 
(ADM, see below)
in stars of mass \mrange living within a variety of dark matter 
environments using the publicly-available code 
Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics 
\citep[\mesa,][]{Paxton2011ModulesMESA, Paxton2013, Paxton2015, Paxton2018, Paxton2019}


  Evidence supporting the claim that $\sim$84\% of the matter in the universe is in 
  an unknown form of dark matter is abundant and varied, ranging from the 
  anisotropy of the microwave background radiation to formation and structures of galaxies 
  \citep[e.g.,][]{jungman_etal96,Bertone+05,PLanck18}. 
  For several decades, the leading candidate has been the so called 
  Weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP). 
  The classic WIMP is a heavy ($\mx \sim 10^2-10^3 \gev$) 
  thermal relic whose contemporary abundance is set 
  by its annihilation rate in the early universe 
  \cite[e.g.,][]{kolb_turner90}. 
  Therefore, WIMPs are thought to have a fairly well established ``standard'' annihilation 
  cross section \citep[e.g.,][]{steigman_etal12}, which is comparable to typical weak-scale 
  cross sections, $\langle \sigma v \rangle \sim 10^{-26} \, \mathrm{cm}^3/\mathrm{s}$. 
  This annihilation of WIMPs, which is so critical to guaranteeing that the 
  correct abundance of dark matter in the contemporary Universe, in turn, 
  limits the number of particles that can accumulate within a star. 
  The rate of capture of new dark matter particles 
  comes to equilibrium with dark matter particle annihilation in the 
  stellar interior \citep{krauss_etal85}. 
  Despite numerous ongoing terrestrial direct detection experiments 
  \citep[see][for a review]{Schumann19} 
  and efforts to detect dark matter indirectly through 
  its annihilation products \citep[reviewed in][]{Slatyer17}, 
  dark matter has not been observed non-gravitationally. The 
  available parameter space for relatively light ($\mx \lesssim 10^2 \mathrm{GeV}$) DM
  is rapidly shrinking, which has triggered a surge in research into 
  alternatives to the long-favored WIMP.


  Asymmetric dark matter (ADM) is an alternative to the classic WIMP in which 
  the relic abundance of the dark matter particle is set by a primordial asymmetry 
  rather than via annihilation \citep[for a review, see][and references therein]{adm_review}. 
  If the baryon and dark matter asymmetries are 
  related, then such models have the appealing property that they explain 
  the fact that the contemporary dark matter and baryon abundances are 
  of the same order of magnitude, which is otherwise surprising because 
  these relic abundances are determined by unrelated physics in the WIMP 
  scenario. Indeed, this was one of the early motivations for ADM-like 
  models \citep[e.g.,][]{Nussinov85,barr_etal90,chivukula_walker90,kaplan92}. 
  The variety of specific incarnations of ADM is broad, 
  but ADM models often predict particle masses smaller than 
  the classic WIMP ($\mx \sim 1-10 \gev$) and little or no 
  contemporary dark matter annihilation for lack of relic 
  dark matter anti-particles. 

  
  These predictions motivate studies to 
  constrain ADM indirectly through stellar astrophysics. The lack of 
  annihilation means that ADM may build up to very large
  quantities within stars because the capture of ADM is never countered 
  by annihilation. Meanwhile, the relatively low masses 
  compared to the classic WIMP mean captured ADM particles orbit within 
  a significant volume of the star, out to $\rx \sim 0.1 R_{\odot}$
  for a Sun-like star, which means that they experience large differences 
  in ambient temperature 
  throughout their orbits and can thus transport energy outward from the 
  stellar core extremely efficiently \citep{Spergel1985EffectInterior}. 
  These features of ADM have already motivated research into the possibility that 
  ADM may alter stellar evolution 
  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

  In this paper we undertake a study of the properties and evolution of 
  stellar populations within halos of ADM. In this first paper on the topic, 
  we further narrow our study to spin-dependent ADM-nucleus scattering. 
  Spin-independent ADM-nucleus scattering leads to behaviors that are 
  qualitatively distinct from spin-dependent scattering; therefore we will 
  present results for the former case in a forthcoming manuscript. 

  We generally find that ADM captured by stars can cool 
  stellar cores to a degree that can have potentially 
  observable effects on stellar populations. In general, 
  the extra cooling due to ADM reduces the main sequence (MS) lifetimes 
  of stars with masses between $\sim 1.2 M_{\odot}$ and $\sim 5 M_{\odot}$, 
  and alters their subsequent evolution. Stars with masses between 
  $0.9 M_{\odot}$ and $1.2 M_{\odot}$ have their lifetimes altered in 
  complicated manner that is not a monotonic function of the model parameters. 
  We summarize our results on stellar lifetimes in Figure~\ref{fig:mstau} 
  and the net effect on stellar populations in the form of stellar isochrones in
  \S~\ref{sec:results}. The effects of stellar cooling are particularly large in 
  environments in which 
  the ambient dark matter density is high and 
  velocity dispersion is low, such that the capture of 
  dark matter is extremely efficient. 
  Thus, these effects will be largest in dwarf satellite galaxies 
  and high-redshift galaxies. 

  In the following section, we summarize the dependence of the capture rate of dark matter 
  within stars on both dark matter and stellar properties. In \S~\ref{sec:methods}, we describe
  our simulations of stellar evolution including cooling due to ADM. We present our results 
  in \S~\ref{sec:results}. We discuss our results and draw conclusions in \S~\ref{sec:discus}.


%----------------------------------------------
\section{Dark Matter Properties and Capture in Stars}
\label{sec:props}

  Probing the parameter space of ADM with simulations of stellar evolution is computationally expensive. 
  Consequently, we show results for a representative set of 
  ADM parameters that we initially chose in order to: 
  (1) make the effects of ADM on stellar evolution significant; 
  and (2) remain consistent with contemporary constraints on 
  dark matter properties (but see the discussion in the next 
  paragraph). For our models we choose $\mx = 5 \gev$ and a 
  spin-dependent dark matter--nucleon scattering cross section of 
  $\sigxp = 10^{-37} \cmsq$.
  Hereafter we will discuss ADM-proton scattering since protons 
  are the only nuclei in MS stars with both 
  a significant abundance and a net spin.
  We assume that ADM self-interactions 
  are negligible throughout; however, 
  it is likely that self-interactions, if they existed, 
  would lead to enhanced cooling 
  \citep[e.g.,][]{Zentner2009High-energySun} and exploring such models 
  would constitute a potentially interesting follow-up to this work.

  While we were performing the numerical simulations described in this 
  work, the PICO collaboration was able to reduce its thresholds, 
  unambiguously excluding dark matter with the specific parameter 
  values listed above \citep{PICO}. Unfortunately, the simulations 
  that we have carried out are computationally intensive and it is 
  impractical to repeat each of the $\sim 600$ stellar evolution 
  simulations. Consequently, we choose to present these results 
  as a qualitative indication of the effects that ADM can have 
  upon stellar evolution. As we will see below, there is 
  significant uncertainty involved in associating a particular 
  stellar effect with a particular dark matter-nucleon scattering 
  cross section due to a variety of model uncertainties. 
  Consequently, while the effects of dark matter within stars 
  will likely be milder than those that we describe here, it is 
  possible that the same, qualitative effects could be realized 
  in nature.

The amount of energy transported by dark matter 
(see \S~\ref{sub:energytransport}) is proportional 
to the amount of ADM within the star. 
In ADM models, in which annihilation of dark matter is negligible, 
the number of dark matter particles within the star at any given time, 
$t$, is determined by ${\rm d}\Nx/{\rm d}t = \Cx$, 
where $\Cx$ is the instantaneous ADM capture rate. 
We use the capture rate from \citet{Zentner2011AsymmetricDwarfs}, 
which is a simplified form valid for dark matter particle masses 
$\mx \lesssim 20 \gev$ \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

  \begin{align}
  \begin{split}
    \label{eq:capturerate}
    \Cx =\ & \Csun
    \Big(\frac{\rhox}{0.4 \gev \cmcinv}\Big)
    \Big(\frac{270 \kms}{\bar{v}}\Big) \\

    & \times \Big(\frac{v_{\mathrm{esc}}}{618 \kms}\Big)^2
    \Big(\frac{\Mstar}{\Msun}\Big)
  \end{split}
  \end{align}
%
  where $\Csun = 5 \times 10^{21} \sinv$, 
  $\rhox$ is the DM density in the stellar environment,
  $\bar{v}$ is the velocity dispersion of dark matter particles 
  in the stellar neighborhood, and $v_{\mathrm{esc}}$ is the escape speed from the 
  surface of the star.


  The first line of Eq.~(\ref{eq:capturerate}) gives 
  the dependence of the capture rate on the stellar environment. 
  Both $\rhox$ and $\bar{v}$ are properties of the local stellar environment 
  and are degenerate with one another in Eq.~(\ref{eq:capturerate}). 
  A higher ambient density of dark matter leads to a higher rate of dark matter capture, 
  while a lower relative velocity between the star and the infalling dark matter leads 
  to a higher probability for capture. 
  Because of this degeneracy, coupled with the fact that these parameters carry 
  considerable uncertainty themselves, 
  it is convenient to parameterize a star's 
  local dark matter environment by an overall 
  factor \citep{Zentner2011AsymmetricDwarfs,Hurst2015},
%
  \begin{equation}
  \gb = \bigg(\frac{\rhox}{0.4 \gev \cmcinv}\bigg) \Bigg(\frac{270 \kms}{\bar{v}}\Bigg).

Normalized in this way, $\gb$ specifies the capture rate, 
$\Cx$, relative to the rate that would be realized in the 
solar neighborhood for the same star. 
From this point on, 
we will characterize a star's dark matter environment using 
$\gb$. In general, we will be most interested in values of $\gb > 1$. 
A value of $\gbzero$ describes a stellar environment with no dark matter 
(hereafter referred to as `standard models' and labeled `\nodm'), 
and $\gbone$ describes the solar neighborhood. 
A value of $\gbpow{2}$ may specify an environment in 
which the dark matter density is 100 times that in the 
solar neighborhood at the same velocity dispersion, 
an environment in which the velocity dispersion is 1/100 that 
of the solar neighborhood at the same density, 
or any of an infinite number of other possible combinations. 

 
It is interesting to consider the range of $\gb$ values 
that would be considered reasonable. If the distribution of 
dark matter within galaxies, such as the Milky Way, follows a 
profile that diverges as the 
\citet[][NFW]{nfwprofile} density profile, then one might expect 
to find dark matter environments near the centers of galaxies with
densities significantly higher than the local value and velocity dispersions significantly
lower than the local value, giving $\gb \gg 1$. Such scenarios 
were explored in \citet{Bertone_Fairbairn08}, \citet{Fairbairn+08}, 
and \citet{Scott+09}. While such large values of $\gb$ may well 
lead to large effects on stellar structure, 
stellar populations near the Galactic Center
are difficult to observe and any assumption 
about the dark matter density profile in the 
inner regions of any galaxy must be considered speculative. 
Interestingly, Local Group dwarf galaxies are extremely dark matter-dominated 
and have well-constrained dark matter profiles and velocity dispersions. 
In some cases, the Local Group dwarfs have densities $\sim 3$ orders 
of magnitude higher than the dark matter density in the Solar neighborhood 
and velocity dispersions that are at least $\sim 2$ orders of magnitude 
smaller than the local value. This suggests that values of $\gb \sim 10^{5-6}$ 
could be realized within Local Group dwarf galaxies and has the further merit that 
$\gb$ within Local Group dwarfs can be measured more precisely in the future. 
A third possibility for large values of the environmental factor 
are early-forming, very high-redshift galaxies. These galaxies begin 
forming in small, dense halos where the environmental boost factor 
can reach $\gb \gtrsim 10^6$ at redshifts $z \gtrsim 10$ \citep{KBD}. 
Of course, these stars will not be directly observable, but it 
is interesting to speculate that such stars could be detected as 
remnants of early mergers with the proto-Milky Way and/or that 
changes to the structure and evolution of these stars could be detected 
indirectly in the chemical evolution of the larger, lower-redshift 
galaxies in which they will be found today. 


Finally, while we have focused on the environmental parameter, $\gb$, 
as a proxy for the dark matter environment in which a star is embedded, 
we note that values of $\gb \ne 1$ can also be mimicked through dark matter 
physics. In particular, dark matter self-interactions can greatly 
enhance the capture rates of dark matter within 
stars \citep{Zentner2009High-energySun}. This effect of dark matter 
self-capture itself grows with increasing ambient density and 
decreasing ambient velocity dispersion, so the two effects 
reinforce one another. For example, a value of $\gb \sim 10^4$ may 
be realized by increasing the ambient dark matter density by a 
factor of $\sim 10^3$, while simultaneously introducing a 
dark matter self-interaction that boosts the number of 
captured dark matter particles by a factor of $\sim 10$. 
We relegate the separation of these effects to future work 
and encapsulate all of this uncertainty into the single 
parameter $\gb$.

Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics \citep[\mesa,][]{Paxton2011ModulesMESA, Paxton2013, Paxton2015, Paxton2018, Paxton2019}, 
release $12115$. 
We used the \texttt{MESA SDK} version $20190830$\footnote{\url{https://zenodo.org/record/3560834}} to compile \mesa.
% \mesa models stellar evolution by simultaneously solving coupled differential equations that describe stellar structure and composition.  
We base our stellar parameter inlist on the \mesa test suite \texttt{1M\_pre\_ms\_to\_wd} inlists and use a metallicity of $Z = 0.0142$. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{12 of the models we ran did not complete (e.g., due to requiring unreasonably small timesteps), and we have excluded them from our final data set. Of these, 2 were $\gbpow{4}$ models, and none of them were either }\nodm \DIFadd{or $\gbpow{6}$ models (these are the three $\gb$ values we highlight below). }\DIFaddend We wrote a module that calculates dark matter capture and energy transport (see \S~\ref{sub:energytransport}) and connects to \mesa simulations via the provided \texttt{extra\_energy\_implicit} hook. Our code is available on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/troyraen/DM-in-Stars}} and through the \mesa Marketplace\footnote{\url{http://cococubed.asu.edu/mesa_market/add-ons.html}}.

To generate isochrones from \mesa's stellar models we must interpolate the data because time steps are adaptive and therefore data is not generated at a consistent set of ages.

\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \mist \DIFaddend code \citep[\mesa Isochrones and Stellar Tracks,][]{Dotter2016MesaIsochrones, Choi2016MESAModels}, which uses a multi-step process to interpolate both the stellar tracks and the mass grid and therefore produces isochrones that are well-sampled, even through dynamic but short lived phases such as the sub-giant branch. However, this method failed to produce isochrones in much of our parameter space of interest\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, including producing no isochrones older than 1 Gyr}\DIFaddend . This is likely due to non-monotonicity in the relation between initial stellar mass and age of a given evolutionary phase, which is present in our data (see \S~\ref{sub:mstau}) but violates assumptions of the code.

\subsection{Energy Transport by Dark Matter}
\label{sub:energytransport}

  The energy transported by captured ADM can, in principle, be computed by solving the Boltzmann equation; however, this strategy is too computationally intensive to combine with a full-scale simulation of the evolution of stellar structure. To reduce the computational costs of our simulations, we estimate ADM energy transport using the approximations of \citet{Spergel1985EffectInterior}. In particular, we assume a Maxwellian phase-space distribution for the ADM and calculate an orbit-averaged temperature, $\Tx$, by requiring that the distribution satisfy the first moment of the Boltzmann equation. This amounts to a requirement on energy conservation: ADM should neither inject nor remove a net energy from the star. The rate of energy transfer (per unit mass) from dark matter to protons is then
  % \tjr{use \ is full space, '\,' '\.' . can also use begin{eqnarray} }
  %
  \begin{align}
  \begin{split}
  \epsx(r) =\ & 8\ \sqrt[]{\frac{2}{\pi}} \frac{\nx(r) \nprot(r)}{\rho(r)} \frac{\mx \mprot}{(\mx+\mprot)^2} \sigxp\\
  & \times \left(\frac{\mprot k \Tx + \mx k T(r)}{\mx \mprot}\right)^{1/2} k [\Tx - T(r)],
  \label{eq:xheat}
  \end{split}
  \end{align}
  %
  where $n(r)$ is a number density, $\rho(r)$ is the mass density, $k$ is Boltzmann's constant, and the subscript p refers to protons. \citep[See][for a detailed derivation]{Spergel1985EffectInterior}.

  Generally, $\nprot$, $\nx$, and $T$ all peak at the center (exceptions noted below), so the energy transport is most efficient here. The number density 
  of dark matter particles, $\nx$ increases in proportion with $\Nx$, so we can expect the effects to increase with both $\gb$ and stellar age through the MS, while hydrogen is abundant. As a star leaves the MS, $\nprot$ drops in the core and spin-dependent ADM energy transport is greatly diminished because there are relatively few protons left with which dark matter may scatter\footnote{This is one of the primary reasons that spin-dependent and spin-independent scattering give qualitatively distinct results. As the star burns H on the MS, the number of protons is reduced, reducing the importance of spin-dependent scattering processes. In the case of spin-independent scattering, the effect gets more important as helium 
  is produced from H burning during the MS.}. 
%   A standard MS temperature profile decreases monotonically with distance from the star's center, but it can become temporarily inverted when ADM moves large amounts of energy away from the center (requires $\gb \gg 1$)

  The sign of $\epsx(r)$ is given by the final term in (\ref{eq:xheat}), $\Tx - T(r)$, which is used to define an ADM characteristic radius, $\rx$, implicitly as
  %
  \begin{align}
    T(r=\rx) = \Tx.
  \end{align}
  %
  Then dark matter takes energy from $r < \rx$ and deposits it at $r > \rx$ for a standard MS temperature profile (monotonically decreasing from the center outward). With our chosen ADM parameters we see typical values:
  %
  \begin{align}
    \rx & \sim \mathcal{O}(0.1 \Rstar) \\
    \lx = (\sigxp \nprot)^{-1} & \sim\mathcal{O}(1 \Rstar)
  \end{align}
  %
  where $\lx$ is the ADM mean free path (implying that it completes several orbits between scattering events). These values allow dark matter to travel much larger distances than photons or ions within the star (which have $l \lesssim 10^{-10} \Rstar$) and to traverse qualitatively distinct 
  regions of the star. This large mean free path is what enables dark matter 
  to serve as such an effective coolant despite being far less numerous than either photons or ions \citep{Spergel1985EffectInterior}.

  % \arz{The preceding statement is probably not true, right? Near $r=0$, the temperature gradient is very small, so energy transport probably is not maximally efficient at the center of the star.} \tjr{What I mean is that the magnitude of the extra heat is largest at r=0, see Fig \ref{fig:m1p0_a}, top right plot. This is generally, but not always, true. Is it the word "efficient" that's a problem?}

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

In standard stellar evolution, with no influence from dark matter, stars with \mrange naturally split into two groups with qualitatively different structures, based on the dominant channel through which they burn hydrogen. Spin-dependent asymmetric dark mater (ADM) affects core hydrogen burning, mainly by flattening the temperature gradient. In this section, we will review standard stellar astrophysics \citep{Kippenhahn2012} and then describe the effects of asymmetric dark matter seen in our MESA simulations.

The dominant burning channel is determined by the core temperature, 
with the transition happening at $\Tc \sim 2 \times 10^7 \K$, 
which corresponds to a stellar mass of $\Mstar \sim1.3 \Msun$.
Stars with $\Mstar \lesssim 1.3 \, \Msun$, which we call low-mass stars, 
burn hydrogen primarily through the proton-proton (pp) chain 
for which the burning rate scales with temperature very roughly as $\epspp \propto T^4$. 
For stars in the mass range $0.4 \lesssim \Mstar/\Msun \lesssim 1.3$, 
the transport of energy away from the core burning region is dominated 
by photon diffusion. Energy transport in the cores of such stars is said 
to be radiative.

Stars with $\Mstar \gtrsim 1.3 \Msun$, 
which we call high-mass stars, 
are dominated by the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle, 
for which the burning rate scales much more strongly with temperature, 
$\epsCNO \propto T^{16-20}$. In CNO-dominated stars, 
radiative energy transport is insufficient 
to carry away the energy produced by hydrogen burning; consequently, they have convective cores.


In \S~\ref{sub:lowmass} and \S~\ref{sub:highmass}, we will consider results for low-mass stars and high-mass stars separately and we will demonstrate that ADM has distinct effects on the evolution of the two groups. \S~\ref{sub:mstau} details changes in MS lifetimes due to ADM energy transport. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\S~\ref{sub:isochrones} discusses }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We discuss }\DIFaddend the effects on surface properties of individual stars \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in \S~\ref{sub:tracks}, and on }\DIFaddend the isochrones of stellar populations \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in \S~\ref{sub:isochrones}}\DIFaddend .

    \caption{$1.0 \Msun$ profiles for \nodm (grey) and $\gbpow{6}$ (dark blue) models. Each set of 3 panels shows stellar profiles of the stars at different evolutionary phases indicated by the fraction of hydrogen in the center, $X_c$, which decreases as the star evolves \DIFaddbeginFL \DIFaddFL{(ZAMS is "zero-age main sequence"}\DIFaddendFL . The profiles in each panel are: 1) $\epsnuc$, the nuclear burning rate in [erg/g/s]; 2) $\epsx$, the rate at which DM transports energy (negative values indicate that energy is being removed), also in [erg/g/s]; 3) log($T$/K), log$_{10}$ of the temperature in [K]. ADM energy transport decreases the temperature and burning rate in the center and increases them in a shell at $m(<r) \sim 0.1 \Msun$. The $\gbpow{6}$ model reaches the $X_c$ evolutionary markers at older ages, relative to the \nodm model, because the changes to the burning rates cause the central hydrogen fraction to decline more slowly.
    }
    \label{fig:m1p0c6}
  \end{figure}


Standard model stars in the mass range \mrangelow have relatively 
low central temperatures and so are powered primarily by the pp chain, 
which is much less sensitive to the temperature than burning via the CNO cycle. 
This means the burning does not peak as strongly at the center and 
radiative transport is sufficient to carry the energy flux, so the core is radiative. 
Without the mixing provided by convection, 
hydrogen depletes first at the very center 
and the burning shifts gradually outward into a shell.


As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:m1p0c6}, 
energy transport by large amounts of ADM causes flatter temperature \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{profiles 
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{gradients in the center 
}\DIFaddend than those seen in the \nodm model. This reduces the burning rate 
in the center (where ADM is removing energy) and increases 
it in a shell (where ADM deposits energy). Indeed, 
the increased burning at 
larger radii ($m(<r) \sim 0.1 \, \Msun$) 
causes a small net increase in the total 
luminosity of the star. Because ADM probes temperature differences 
over large portions of the star, 
energy transport by ADM remains efficient despite the shallower 
temperature gradient. The increased temperature at $m(<r) \gtrsim 0.1 \Msun$ 
means that more hydrogen burns during the MS in low-mass ADM models 
than in their \nodm counterparts. These two competing effects 
dictate the gross evolution of the star. For low values of 
$\gb$ (weaker ADM influence), the increase in the total 
amount of fuel wins and the stellar MS lifetime is an  
increasing function of $\gb$. At values of $\gb \gtrsim 10^3$, 
the burning rate continues to increase, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{but }\DIFaddend little additional 
fuel is burned because of the precipitous drop in temperature 
at larger radii, which cannot be overcome by the energy transport. 
The result is that the MS lifetime of the star decreases 
with increasing environmental factor for $\gb \gtrsim 10^3$. 
(We will discuss stellar lifetimes further in \S~\ref{sub:mstau}).
Stars in this regime have a higher surface luminosity than their \nodm counterparts, at fixed central hydrogen fraction\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, and move along their }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. However, at fixed luminosity we should expect their effective temperatures to be roughly the same, because these are equilibrium points dictated by the equations of stellar structure. Indeed, this is what we see in our models. The result is that stars of a given mass but different ADM content move along roughly the same }\DIFaddend tracks in an HR diagram\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{at a faster pace}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, but they do so at different rates}\DIFaddend . (We will discuss stellar tracks \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in \S~\ref{sub:tracks} }\DIFaddend and population isochrones in \S~\ref{sub:isochrones}.)
% \arz{I would try to rephrase the following. This is not too shocking. For a 
% given luminosity, the structure is more or less set by the equations 
% of stellar structure. So we shouldn't expect a given luminosity to 
% correspond to a very different surface temperature under most 
% circumstances. However, what is different is the time sequence 
% of events. }


Previous work by \cite{Iocco+12} found that solar mass stars 
in dense ADM environments may experience dramatic oscillations 
in both their core structure and surface properties, 
due to the large amounts of energy that ADM removes from the center, 
but noted that they were unable to determine whether it was 
a physical effect or a numerical artifact. Our initial simulations, 
using \mesa release $10398$, resulted in similar oscillations. In those models, 
ADM energy transport caused the temperature profile 
to become inverted, with the central temperature falling below the ADM temperature. 
Once this occurred, ADM began transporting energy back toward the center of the star. 
This raised the central temperature until it surpassed the ADM temperature again, 
causing ADM energy transport to again reverse direction and move energy away from the center. 
This cycle was self-reinforcing, causing large oscillations in the core temperature, 
density, etc., which propagated outward and resulted in large 
oscillations in surface properties as well.


Upon further investigation, 
we found that these simulations had poor energy conservation 
due to numerical artifacts. 
A new \mesa version had been released since we had begun 
this work that included improved energy conservation schemes. 
When we updated to \mesa release $12115$ and ran these models again, 
the energy conservation was much improved, 
and the central temperature was reduced such that 
it was very close to the ADM temperature but never 
dropped below it. Since $\Tc > \Tx$ throughout the star's lifetime, 
ADM energy transport never reverses direction and the oscillations 
seen previously are absent. We conclude that the oscillations in our initial simulations
were a numerical artifact.

\subsection{High-Mass Stars}

    \includegraphics[width=0.47\textwidth]{plots/m3p5.png}
    \caption{Same as Figure~\ref{fig:m1p0c6} for $3.5 \Msun$ models, except that the 3rd panel in each set shows log($D$), where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient for convective mixing in [cm$^2$/s]. In the \nodm model the convective core retreats \textit{toward} the center over time, and the burning rate peaks at the center until the end of the main sequence when the burning rate drops dramatically and a shell of strong burning appears suddenly. In the $\gbpow{6}$ model, convection at the very center shuts off relatively early in the MS and a convective shell retreats \textit{away} from the center over time. The peak burning rate shifts gradually outward, following the inner edge of the convective shell. The $\gbpow{6}$ model reaches the $X_c$ evolutionary markers at younger ages, relative to the \nodm model, since convection cannot replenish the fuel at the center.
    }
    \label{fig:m3p5}
  \end{figure}

In standard models, MS stars with $\Mstar \gtrsim 1.3 \Msun$ 
are powered primarily by the CNO cycle.
This has several important consequences:
(1) the burning rate is much higher than in pp-dominated stars;
(2) the burning rate is extremely sensitive to core temperature; 
(3) temperature gradients in the stellar core are relatively steep; 
and (4) stellar cores must be convective in order 
to carry away the energy produced by core hydrogen burning. 
Convective energy transport in the star also replenishes the 
core with unburnt hydrogen as the star evolves.
Once hydrogen throughout the convective zone is depleted, 
the burning rate rapidly decreases and 
the star loses more energy at its surface than is 
being generated by burning. Gravity temporarily overcomes pressure support and 
the star contracts until the internal temperature increase is sufficient 
to ignite hydrogen in a shell outside the depleted core. This restructuring 
produces the so-called "convective hook" in an HR diagram 
as the star leaves the main sequence \citep{Kippenhahn2012}.

If a star captures enough ADM, the combination of dark matter + radiative energy 
transport becomes sufficient to carry the flux from nuclear burning at a 
temperature gradient that is insufficient to support convection. 
In other words, the additional energy transport by ADM can turn off convection within the stellar core. 
This can be seen in 
Figure~\ref{fig:m3p5} for a $3.5 \Msun$, $\gbpow{6}$ star. 
Convection disappears from the center first 
(where ADM energy transport is most efficient) 
and retreats away from the core, into a narrowing shell. 
Without convective mixing, the hydrogen fuel supply depletes first 
at the very center (instead of simultaneously throughout the core) and 
the burning concomitantly shifts gradually into a shell, 
following the lower boundary of the convective zone. 
This can be seen in the time progression (down the page) 
of the $\gbpow{6}$ (dark blue) model in Figure~\ref{fig:m3p5}. 
The shift to shell burning is similar to the behavior of standard {\em low mass} 
stars.

For the purposes of this figure this is defined as the lowest $\Mstar$ for which the average (over the MS) mass of the convective core is greater than 0.01 Mstar. Stars to the right of the \nodm marker (grey diamond) have decreased lifetimes due to a reduction in the size of the convective core, which reduces the amount of hydrogen available for burning.

\label{sub:mstau}

\DIFaddend In Figure~\ref{fig:mstau} we summarize the effects of ADM on main sequence (MS) lifetimes relative to a standard \nodm star of the same mass. For the purposes of this \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{plot}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{paper}\DIFaddend , we have {\em defined} the MS to end when the fractional abundance of hydrogen in the center, $X_c$, falls below $10^{-3}$. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$X_c$ declines rapidly }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Once $X_c < 10^{-3}$ the hydrogen burning rate is greatly reduced and the star transitions out of the MS and onto the sub-giant branch.

Our relatively moderate choice of $10^{-3}$ highlights changes in the core of the star during the bulk of the MS, rather than changes in the transition period between the MS and the sub-giant branch. We discuss ADM's affects on this transition period in \S~\ref{sub:tracks}.

dark matter effect, parameterized by $\gb$. This complicated dependence on the amount of 
captured \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{dark matter }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ADM }\DIFaddend is due to the competition between \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{increases burning rate }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{increased burning rates }\DIFaddend and increased 
availability of burnable hydrogen fuel as discussed in \S~\ref{sub:lowmass}. 


At higher masses, the influence of ADM on stellar lifetimes is clearer. 
ADM shortens the lifetimes of high mass stars ($\Mstar \gtrsim 1.3 \Msun$). 
In \nodm models, the central convection zone extends beyond the burning region, 
giving the star a source of fresh nuclear fuel as hydrogen from outside 
of the core is mixed into the center. 
Since ADM shuts off convection in the center, 
the star no longer gets this influx of fresh hydrogen. 
Consequently, the star has less fuel available to burn, 
and so it leaves the MS faster than the \nodm models. 
Note that the appearance of a convective core \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(diamonds, Fig~\ref{fig:mstau}) }\DIFaddend shifts 
to higher masses with increasing $\gb$ 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(diamonds in Figure~\ref{fig:mstau}) 
}\DIFdelend due to larger amounts of ADM which can carry larger energy fluxes. 
The effect disappears abruptly as $\Mstar$ increases because stellar 
lifetimes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(which }\DIFdelend scale as $\Mstar^{\sim 2.5}$ \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{) 
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and 
}\DIFaddend quickly become too short for a sufficient amount of 
ADM to build up
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in the star 
}\DIFdelend (recall that the ADM capture rate scales roughly linearly with $\Mstar$), 
while the luminosity of the star increases rapidly with mass 
(roughly, $L \propto \Mstar^{3.5}$), 
meaning that more energy must be transported 
in order to alter the stellar structure.

In addition to the trends we have discussed, Figure~\ref{fig:mstau} has several abrupt dips (e.g., at $2.4 \Msun$) and spikes (e.g., at $2.55 \Msun$). This is due to rotational mixing that turns on \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in a shell }\DIFdelend part-way through the MS and funnels fresh hydrogen \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{fuel }\DIFdelend to the center, which increases the lifetimes (spikes). The dips result when the \nodm model exhibits this feature, but the ADM model of the same mass does not. This rotational mixing occurs sporadically (i.e. at isolated masses, not in a continuous range of masses) in our models and may or may not be physical. However, it cannot be a bug introduced by our ADM energy transport module since \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{it happens in both ADM and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{some }\DIFaddend \nodm models \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.

HR diagram for many of our models. The tracks begin on the

Stars evolve off of the ZAMS in a mass-dependent manner that is

As is evident in Fig.~\ref{fig:tracks}, 
the effects of ADM on the evolutionary track 
of any individual star are generally subtle. 
Roughly speaking, this is not surprising. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The cooling induced by ADM effects only stellar 
cores. The chemical compositions, }\DIFdelend %DIF >  The cooling induced by ADM effects only stellar cores. 
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{At a fixed central hydrogen fraction, stars containing ADM have different surface luminosities than their standard model counterparts, which is a result of ADM altering the structure of the star. This can be seen in the difference in location between the $X_c=10^{-3}$ markers in Fig.~\ref{fig:tracks} (x's for ADM models, solid black line for }\nodm \DIFadd{models).
However, if we instead consider stars at fixed luminosity, the }\DIFaddend temperature profiles, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{chemical compositions, 
}\DIFaddend opacities, and other properties of the overlying zones 
are approximately unaltered by ADM cooling. Consequently, 
the gross properties of the stellar photosphere, which are 
determined via the equations of stellar structure, are 
approximately fixed\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend at fixed luminosity. 
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The result is that both ADM and standard model stars of a given mass follow roughly the same tracks in the HR diagram, but they do so at different rates.
}\DIFaddend 


Nonetheless, there are some small differences between 
standard evolutionary tracks and the tracks of stars 
with ADM. For example, consider the track of the 
$1.75 \Msun$ star in the left panel, corresponding 
to an environmental factor of $\gb = 10^4$.
The standard 
model of stellar evolution shows a kink in the evolutionary 
track as the star exits the MS. This kink is known as the 
{\em convective hook}. The convective hook is caused by 
an overall contraction of the convective cores of the 
stars after hydrogen depletion. During this phase, 
$T_{\rm eff}$ increases. Eventually, at the hottest point 
on the hook, contraction of the former convective core 
is sufficient to ignite burning in a shell. After this 
point, shell burning ensues and the star continues to 
evolve along the sub-giant branch. What is clear from 
the evolutionary track of the $1.75M_{\odot}$ star 
in the left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:tracks} is that 
this evolutionary track exhibits {\em no convective hook.} 
This is because convection within the stellar core has 
been shut off by the ADM in these models. Instead of 
going through a phase of core collapse followed by shell 
burning, such stars make a smooth transition to shell burning 
and, thus, a smooth transition to the sub-giant branch. 
The absence of convective hooks is evident 
for a wider range of masses in the right hand 
panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:tracks}, which corresponds 
to a larger environmental factor of $\gb=10^6$. 


The convective hook feature has been clearly 
seen in many open clusters for which 
the main sequence turn off lies between $\sim 1.3\Msun$ 
and $\sim 2\Msun$, corresponding to stellar 
ages of $\sim 1\, \mathrm{Gyr}$ to $\sim 4\mathrm{Gyr}$. 
However, this does not yet provide any strong 
statement about the nature of dark matter because 
none of those environments are thought to contain 
significant amounts of dark matter. 
Exploiting the convective hook feature 
would require the serendipitous identification 
of a stellar population of the appropriate age, associated with a significant amount of dark matter, and containing a sufficiently
large number of stars such that the ephemeral 
convective hook and sub-giant phases of 
evolution are well sampled.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In Figure~\ref{fig:teff} we plot the effective temperatures with respect to stellar age to better understand the transition from the MS to the sub-giant branch, seen here as the difference between $X_c = 10^{-3}$ (triangles) and the sharp drop in $\Teff$. A star's exit off of the main sequence is triggered when the core hydrogen fuel supply is depleted and the burning rate decreases such that it no longer provides sufficient pressure support and the star begins to collapse. Densities and temperatures increase until the bottom layer of hydrogen, now in a shell surrounding the core, ignites. The outward pressure resulting from increased shell burning causes the star's outer envelope to expand and cool at roughly constant luminosity, seen in Figure~\ref{fig:teff} as a large, sudden drop in $\Teff$. In models with no ADM, this transition period is more abrupt in high mass stars due to the mixing induced by their convective cores, which causes hydrogen to become depleted throughout the core simultaneously and shell burning to appear suddenly (see \S~\ref{sub:highmass}). In standard model low mass stars the cores are not convective, and so hydrogen depletes first at the very center and the burning shifts into a shell more gradually (see \S~\ref{sub:lowmass}). 
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The temporal difference between ADM and standard models in the location of the sudden drop in $\Teff$ (when increased shell burning causes the envelope to expand) is another indicator of the change in MS lifetime. Unlike our definition of the end of the main sequence ($X_c = 10^{-3}$) this indicator is based on surface properties and occurs towards the end of the large structural changes the happen during the transition period. In some cases (e.g., in the $1.75 \Msun$, $\gbpow{4}$ model) this temporal difference is much smaller than the change in MS lifetime given by our definition of leaving the MS (seen here as the difference between the triangle markers of the ADM model and its standard model counterpart), and in other cases (e.g., in the $1.0 \Msun$, $\gbpow{6}$ model) it is larger.
}

\DIFadd{ADM can affect both burning rates and stellar structure (e.g., convection), and therefore it is not surprising that ADM affects the timescale of a star's transition off of the main sequence. High mass stars that skip the convective hook due to ADM energy transport take longer to move through this transition period because the burning shifts gradually into a shell (see \S~\ref{sub:highmass} for details). This behavior is very similar to standard model low mass stars. Conversely, the $1.0 \Msun$ AMD models move through this period more quickly than their }\nodm \DIFadd{counterpart. This is likely due to the fact that ADM has caused higher burning rates at the outer edge of the core during the MS, so that mixing during this transition period brings more helium into the center than in the standard model star. These shifts are opposite the shifts in MS lifetimes, and the net result is that this feature in $\Teff$ always occurs either concurrently or earlier in the ADM model than in its standard model counterpart.

It is interesting to speculate on ways in which these effects could be 
used to identify and/or constrain dark matter or ways in which these 
effects may, at least, serve as an element of uncertainty in the analysis 
of stellar populations. Any constraint on dark matter arising from these 
effects requires very high-quality observations of a stellar population 
residing in an environment with a large ambient dark matter density and thus there will be a significant element of serendipity involved.

In addition, the tip of the red giant branch may occur at a lower luminosity. The tip of the red giant branch is commonly used as a distance indicator
%DIF >  , and is also known to occur at lower effective temperatures in more metal-rich populations, 
so ADM may add a source of uncertainty to these studies.
Finally, the metallicity is known to affect many of the properties we have discussed (e.g., the locations of various phases in the HR diagram), so ADM may be a contaminant here as well.

%DIF >  {\color{red}TJH: One avenue for turning our results into a constraint is to explore the effect on asteroseismology. That's what I'm working on now. I'm optimistic to have a completed draft in a couple months.

%DIF >  For future work we could say something like, ``ADM mainly effects the core of the star. It is possible that this could have observable effects on the asteroseismology of Sun-like Main Sequence and Red Giant Branch stars. This could be seen in e.g. the small frequency separation--a diganostic that is sensitive to the core structure of the star."}

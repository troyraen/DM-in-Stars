I give particular emphasis to processes where large uncertainties still exist as they have strong impact on stellar properties derived from large compilations of tracks and isochrones, and are therefore of fundamental importance in many fields of astrophysics.},

@article{Gould1992CosmologicalAnnihilations,
abstract = {If weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) comprise the dark matter, then the ratio of their annihilation signals from the centers of the sun and earth can be used to measure the degree to which WIMP capture and annihilation have come into equilibrium in the earth. This would provide a measure of, or a limit on, the WIMP annihilation cross section. The annihilation cross section is, in turn, inversely related by a standard Lee-Weinberg calculation to the cosmological density of WIMPs, Omegax. If the next generation of detectors finds a signal from the sun, an upper bound, lower bound, or measurement of Omegax of O(0.1), depending on whether there is a comparable signal, no signal, or a small signal from the earth. The chain of reasoning which leads to this conclusion is broken if the WIMPs have primarily spin-dependent interaction cross sections, but this possibility may be checked using direct-detection experiments. A very accurate analytic formula is given for the integrated WIMP capture by the entire sun.},

If that particle has a mass between 5 and 60 GeV, then it will populate only the inner "solar neutrino unit-producing" core and not the larger luminosity-producing region. If it has a scattering cross sectin on protons of 4 $\backslash$times 10{\^{}}{\{}-36{\}} cm{\^{}}2, then a fractional abundance of 10{\^{}}{\{}-12{\}} will have order unity effect on the Sun's thermal transport, in the direction of decreasing the expected neutrino signature. For smaller cross sections, the required abuandance rises in the inverse porportion, so that cross sections as small as 10{\^{}}{\{}-46{\}} cm{\^{}}2 are effective if the concentration is as large as 10{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}.

@article{Zentner2009High-energySun,
abstract = {A potential flux of high-energy neutrinos from the annihilation of dark matter particles trapped within the Sun has been exploited to place indirect limits on particle dark matter. In most models, the dark matter interacts weakly, but the possibility of a dark matter particle with a large cross section for elastic scattering with itself has been proposed in several contexts. I study the consequences of such dark matter self-interactions for the high-energy neutrino flux from annihilation within the Sun. The self-interaction may allow dark matter in the halo to be captured within the Sun by scattering off of previously-captured dark matter within the Sun. This effect is not negligible in acceptable and accessible regions of parameter space. Enhancements in the predicted high-energy neutrino flux from the Sun of tens to hundreds of percent can be realized in broad regions of parameter space. Enhancements as large as factors of several hundred may be realized in extreme regions of the viable parameter space. Large enhancements require the dark matter annihilation cross section to be relatively small, sigma*v {\textless}{\~{}} 10{\^{}}-27 cm{\^{}}3/s. This phenomenology is interesting. First, self-capture is negligible for the Earth, so dark matter self-interactions break the correspondence between the solar and terrestrial neutrino signals. Likewise, the correspondence between indirect and direct detection limits on scattering cross sections on nuclei is broken by the self-interaction. These broken correspondences may evince strong dark matter self-interactions. In some cases, self-capture can lead to observable indirect signals in regions of parameter space where limits on dark matter-nucleon cross sections from direct detection would indicate that no such signal should be observable.},

abstract = {We substantially update the capabilities of the open-source software instrument Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). MESA can now simultaneously evolve an interacting pair of differentially rotating stars undergoing transfer and loss of mass and angular momentum, greatly enhancing the prior ability to model binary evolution. New MESA capabilities in fully coupled calculation of nuclear networks with hundreds of isotopes now allow MESA to accurately simulate the advanced burning stages needed to construct supernova progenitor models. Implicit hydrodynamics with shocks can now be treated with MESA, enabling modeling of the entire massive star lifecycle, from pre-main-sequence evolution to the onset of core collapse and nucleosynthesis from the resulting explosion. Coupling of the GYRE non-adiabatic pulsation instrument with MESA allows for new explorations of the instability strips for massive stars while also accelerating the astrophysical use of asteroseismology data. We improve the treatment of mass accretion, giving more accurate and robust near-surface profiles. A new MESA capability to calculate weak reaction rates "on-the-fly" from input nuclear data allows better simulation of accretion induced collapse of massive white dwarfs and the fate of some massive stars. We discuss the ongoing challenge of chemical diffusion in the strongly coupled plasma regime, and exhibit improvements in MESA that now allow for the simulation of radiative levitation of heavy elements in hot stars. We close by noting that the MESA software infrastructure provides bit-for-bit consistency for all results across all the supported platforms, a profound enabling capability for accelerating MESA's development.},

abstract = {We substantially update the capabilities of the open source software package Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), and its one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESA Star. Improvements in MESA Star's ability to model the evolution of giant planets now extends its applicability down to masses as low as one-tenth that of Jupiter. The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology enabled by the space-based Kepler and CoRoT missions motivates our full coupling of the ADIPLS adiabatic pulsation code with MESA Star. This also motivates a numerical recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more easily implemented when many nuclei are present at non-negligible abundances. This impacts the way in which MESA Star calculates semi-convective and thermohaline mixing. We exhibit the evolution of 3-8 Msun stars through the end of core He burning, the onset of He thermal pulses, and arrival on the white dwarf cooling sequence. We implement diffusion of angular momentum and chemical abundances that enable calculations of rotating-star models, which we compare thoroughly with earlier work. We introduce a new treatment of radiation-dominated envelopes that allows the uninterrupted evolution of massive stars to core collapse. This enables the generation of new sets of supernovae, long gamma-ray burst, and pair-instability progenitor models. We substantially modify the way in which MESA Star solves the fully coupled stellar structure and composition equations, and we show how this has improved MESA's performance scaling on multi-core processors. Updates to the modules for equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, and atmospheric boundary conditions are also provided. We describe the MESA Software Development Kit (SDK) that packages all the required components needed to form a unified and maintained build environment for MESA. [Abridged]},

abstract = {We update the capabilities of the software instrument Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) and enhance its ease of use and availability. Our new approach to locating convective boundaries is consistent with the physics of convection, and yields reliable values of the convective core mass during both hydrogen and helium burning phases. Stars with {\$}M{\textless}8\backslash,{\{}\backslashrm M{\_}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} become white dwarfs and cool to the point where the electrons are degenerate and the ions are strongly coupled, a realm now available to study with MESA due to improved treatments of element diffusion, latent heat release, and blending of equations of state. Studies of the final fates of massive stars are extended in MESA by our addition of an approximate Riemann solver that captures shocks and conserves energy to high accuracy during dynamic epochs. We also introduce a 1D capability for modeling the effects of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities that, in combination with the coupling to a public version of the STELLA radiation transfer instrument, creates new avenues for exploring Type II supernovae properties. These capabilities are exhibited with exploratory models of pair-instability supernova, pulsational pair-instability supernova, and the formation of stellar mass black holes. The applicability of MESA is now widened by the capability of importing multi-dimensional hydrodynamic models into MESA. We close by introducing software modules for handling floating point exceptions and stellar model optimization, and four new software tools -- MESAWeb, MESA-Docker, pyMESA, and mesastar.org -- to enhance MESA's education and research impact.},

This is because the structure equations have to be solved in parallel with the energy transport equations. If timesteps are chosen to be small enough, convergence is very rapid. It is convenient to reformulate the original structure equations as d ln r dm = 1 4$\pi$ $\rho$r 3 ; d ln P dm = − Gm 4$\pi$P r 4 . In order to reduce the dynamic range of the variables, we definee x = ln r, y = ln P and q = ln $\rho$ and input an equation of state $\rho$(P) or equivalently q(y). We rewrite these differential equations as finite-difference equations to be zeroed at each position i: $\phi$ i = y i − y i−1 + G 8$\pi$ m 2 i − m 2},

These captured particles may subsequently annihilate, heating the stellar core and preventing the WD from cooling.

Consequently, DM evaporation is less important in WDs and DM with masses {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashchi{\}} \backslashgtrsim 100\backslash, \backslashkev{\$} and annihilation cross-sections orders of magnitude below the canonical thermal cross-section ({\$}\backslashsigmav \backslashgtrsim 10{\^{}}{\{}-46{\}}\backslash, \backslashcm{\^{}}3{\$}/s) can significantly alter WD cooling in particular astrophysical environments. We consider WDs in globular clusters (GCs) and dwarf galaxies. If the parameters of the DM particle are known, then the temperature of the coolest WD in a GC can be used to constrain the DM density of the cluster's halo (potentially even ruling out the presence of a halo if the inferred density is of order the ambient Galactic density). Recently several direct detection experiments have seen signals whose origins might be due to low mass DM. In this paper, we show that if these claims from CRESST, DAMA, CDMS-Si, and CoGeNT could be interpreted as DM, then observations of NGC 6397 limit the fraction of DM in that cluster to be {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}DM{\}}{\}} \backslashlesssim 10{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$}.

abstract = {We study the effects of feebly or non-annihilating weakly interacting Dark Matter (DM) particles on stars that live in DM environments denser than that of our Sun. We find that the energy transport mechanism induced by DM particles can produce unusual conditions in the core of Main Sequence stars, with effects which can potentially be used to probe DM properties. We find that solar mass stars placed in DM densities of rhochi{\textgreater}= e2 GeV/cm3 are sensitive to Spin-Dependent scattering cross-section sigmsd {\textgreater}= e-37 cm2 and a DM particle mass as low as mchi=5 GeV, accessing a parameter range weakly constrained by current direct detection experiments.},

@article{Paxton2019,
abstract = {We update the capabilities of the open-knowledge software instrument Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). RSP is a new functionality in MESAstar that models the non-linear radial stellar pulsations that characterize RR Lyrae, Cepheids, and other classes of variable stars. We significantly enhance numerical energy conservation capabilities, including during mass changes. For example, this enables calculations through the He flash that conserve energy to better than 0.001 {\%}. To improve the modeling of rotating stars in MESA, we introduce a new approach to modifying the pressure and temperature equations of stellar structure, and a formulation of the projection effects of gravity darkening. A new scheme for tracking convective boundaries yields reliable values of the convective-core mass, and allows the natural emergence of adiabatic semiconvection regions during both core hydrogen- and helium-burning phases. We quantify the parallel performance of MESA on current generation multicore architectures and demonstrate improvements in the computational efficiency of radiative levitation. We report updates to the equation of state and nuclear reaction physics modules. We briefly discuss the current treatment of fallback in core-collapse supernova models and the thermodynamic evolution of supernova explosions. We close by discussing the new MESA Testhub software infrastructure to enhance source-code development.},

abstract = {In this paper, hypothetical particles are assumed to make up the missing dynamical mass in the Galaxy, providing a mass density between 0.01 and 0.1 solar mass/cu pc and with a velocity dispersion of about 30 (disk) or 300 (halo) km/s. The number of particles which would be captured by the sun up to its present age by the capture mechanism of scattering off individual nucleons in the sun and into bound orbits is computed. For scattering cross sections not too far from the value of 4 x 10 to the -36th sq cm, which is optimal for suppressing solar neutrinos, it is found that just the right number can be captured. The solutions to the neutrino problem in the sun and the missing mass problem in the Galaxy may thus be one and the same.},

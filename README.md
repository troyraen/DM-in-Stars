# DM-in-Stars #

Explores the effects of dark matter (DM) on stellar evolution. Includes: (1) a module written to incorporate the effects of DM energy transport into the stellar evolution code MESA ([Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics](http://mesa.sourceforge.net)), and (2) supporting code to facilitate running MESA + DM models.

This branch includes all of the code used in the preperation of _The Effects of Asymmetric Dark Matter on Stellar Evolution I: Spin-Dependent Scattering_ ([Raen et al., 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.503.5611R/abstract)). The paper used MESA version 12115 and MESA SDK version 20190830.
